  <p class="about">
    I am a software engineer based out of New Orleans, LA who loves to spend time with the family, cook, workout, and build stuff with legos.
    I made this personal site to house a few tools for my own use, but feel free to look around the site to see recipes, lego instructions, and workout templates.
    Please email via the contact link below with any comments or suggestions.
