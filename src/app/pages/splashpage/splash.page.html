  <p class="about">
    I am a software engineer based out of New Orleans, LA who loves to spend time with the family, cook, workout, and build stuff with legos.
    I am using this quarantine to try new recipes and record those that my family really enjoys.
    Look around the site to see recipes, lego instructions, and workout templates.
