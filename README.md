## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component components/<category>/<component-name>` to generate a new component.
Run `ng generate service services/<actions | content | site>/<service-name>` to generate a new service.
Run `ng generate pipe pipes/<pipe-name>` to generate a new pipe.
You can also use `ng generate directive|class|guard|enum|module`.

All services, components, and pipes must be indexed and imported as a group into app.module.ts.

Types and interfaces are defined in and exported from `src/app/utilities/types.ts`.
Interface naming convention is to begin with `I`.

Non-private keys are stored in the environment.
